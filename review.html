                We cannot thank you enough! Sophie was beyond thrilled to get
                your message and it really helped her get through a little bit
                of missing home!

                I surprised my best friend with a pep talk when she was feeling
                down. Mr Macqueen's message was beyond what either of us
                expected!

                She's watched it multiple times, shared it with friends and
                family, and continues to tell everyone about it. Thank you so
                much for making her day/month/year!

                She absolutely loved the video you made for her! Thank you for
                talking from the heart! She bawled her eyes out and lifted her
                spirits up so much!
